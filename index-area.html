Convex programming duality is usually stated in its most general form, with convex objective functions and convex constraints.
At this level of generality the process of constructing a dual of a convex program is not so simple, in contrast to LP duality where
there is a simple set of rules one can use for the same purpose.
In this article, we consider a special class of convex programs: with convex objective functions and {\em linear} constraints,
and derive a simple set of rules to construct the dual, analogous to LPs.
We also show applications of this: the main application in this article will be to derive convex programs for Fisher markets.

  Identical products being sold at different prices in different
locations is a common phenomenon. To model such scenarios, we supplement the classical Fisher market model by introducing {\em transaction costs}. For every buyer $i$ and good $j$, there is a transaction cost of $c_{ij}$; if the price of good $j$ is $p_j$, then the cost to the buyer $i$ {\em per unit} of $j$ is $p_j + c_{ij}$. The same good can thus be sold at different (effective) prices to different buyers. We provide a combinatorial algorithm that computes $\epsilon$-approximate equilibrium prices and allocations in $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}(n+\log{m})mn\log(B/\epsilon)\right)$
operations - where $m$ is the number goods, $n$ is the number of buyers and $B$ is the sum of the budgets of all the buyers.

Market Equilibria in Polynomial time for

<div id="absPLC" style="display:none"><font face="Arial" size="3">
<p> We consider markets in the classical Arrow-Debreu model. There are n
agents and m goods. Each buyer has a concave utility function
(of the bundle of goods he/she buys) and an initial bundle. At an
``equilibrium'' set of prices for goods, if each individual buyer
separately exchanges the initial bundle for an optimal bundle at
the set prices, the market clears, i.e., all goods are exactly
consumed. Classical theorems guarantee the existence of equilibria,
but computing them has been the subject of much recent research.
In the related area of Multi-Agent Games, much attention has been paid to
the complexity as well as algorithms.
While most general problems are
hard, polynomial time algorithms have been developed for restricted
classes of games, when one assumes  the
number of strategies is constant.
</p>
  <P>
For the Market Equilibrium problem, several important special cases of
utility functions have been tackled.
 Here we begin a program for this
problem similar to that for multi-agent games, where general utilities
are considered.  We begin by showing that if the utilities are
separable piece-wise linear concave (PLC) functions, and the number of
goods (or alternatively the number of buyers) is constant, then we can
compute an exact equilibrium in polynomial time. Our
technique for the constant number of goods is to decompose the space
of price vectors into cells using certain hyperplanes, so that in each
cell, each buyer's threshold marginal utility is known. Still, one
needs to solve a linear optimization problem in each cell.
We then show the main result - that for general
(non-separable) PLC utilities, an exact equilibrium can be found in
polynomial time provided the number of goods is constant. The starting
point of the algorithm is a ``cell-decomposition'' of the space of
price vectors using polynomial surfaces (instead of hyperplanes).
We use results from computational algebraic geometry to bound the
number of such cells.
For solving the problem inside each cell, we introduce and use a novel
LP-duality based method. We note that if the number of
buyers and agents both can vary, the problem is PPAD hard even for the
very special case of  PLC utilities such as Leontief utilities and separable PLC utilities.

The Price of Truthfulness for Pay-Per-Click Auctions

<P>
  We analyze the problem of designing a truthful pay-per-click auction where
the click-through-rates (CTR) of the bidders are unknown to the auction. Such an auction faces the classic explore/exploit dilemma: while gathering information about the click through rates of advertisers, the mechanism may loose revenue; however, this gleaned information may prove valuable in the future for a more profitable allocation. In this sense, such mechanisms are prime candidates to be designed using multi-armed bandit techniques. However, a naive application of multi-armed bandit algorithms would not take into account the strategic considerations of the players --- players might manipulate their bids (which determine the auction's revenue) in a way as to maximize their own utility. Hence,
we consider the natural restriction that the auction be truthful.

The revenue that we could hope to achieve is the expected revenue of a
Vickrey auction that knows the true CTRs, and we define the truthful regret to be the difference
between the expected revenue of the auction and this Vickrey revenue. This work sharply characterizes what regret is achievable, under a truthful restriction. We show that this truthful restriction imposes statistical limits on the achievable regret --- the achievable regret is $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$, while for traditional bandit algorithms (without the truthful restriction) the achievable regret is $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{1/2})$ (where $T$ is the number of rounds). We term the extra $T^{1/6}$ factor, the `price of truthfulness'.

  We study bargaining networks, discussed in a recent paper of Kleinberg and
Tardos, from the perspective of cooperative game theory. In
particular we examine three solution concepts, the nucleolus, the core
center and the core median.
All  solution concepts define unique solutions, so they provide
testable predictions.
We define a new monotonicity property that is a natural axiom of any bargaining game solution,
and we prove that all three of them satisfy this monotonicity property.
This is actually in contrast to the conventional wisdom for general cooperative games that
monotonicity and the core condition (which is a basic property that all three of them satisfy)
are incompatible with each other.
Our proofs are based on a
primal-dual argument (for the nucleolus) and on the FKG inequality (for the
core center and the core median). We further observe some qualitative differences between the
solution concepts. In particular, there are cases where a strict version of
our monotonicity property is a natural axiom, but only the core center and the core median
satisfy it. On the other hand, the nucleolus is easy to compute, whereas
computing the core center or the core median is #P-hard (yet it can be approximated in
polynomial time).</p></font>

  Bargaining games on exchange networks have been
studied by both economists and sociologists. A Balanced Out-
come for such a game is an equilibrium concept that
combines notions of stability and fairness. In a recent paper,
Kleinberg and Tardos introduced balanced outcomes to the
computer science community and provided a polynomial-time
algorithm to compute the set of such outcomes. Their work left
open a pertinent question: are there natural, local dynamics that
converge quickly to a balanced outcome? In this paper, we provide
a partial answer to this question by showing that simple edge-
balancing dynamics converge to a balanced outcome whenever one
exists.

  We exhibit a new computational-based definition of awareness,
informally that our level of unawareness of an object is the amount
of time needed to generate that object within a certain environment.
We give several examples to show this notion matches our intuition
in scenarios where one organizes, accesses and transfers
information. We also give a formal process-independent definition of
awareness based on Levin's universal enumeration.

We show the usefulness of computational awareness by showing how it
relates to decision making, and how others can manipulate our
decision making with appropriate advertising, in particular, we show
connections to sponsored search and brand awareness. Understanding
awareness can also help rate the effectiveness of various user
interfaces designed to access information.

  In this paper, we study competitive markets - a market is
competitive if increasing the endowment of any one buyer does not in-
crease the equilibrium utility of any other buyer. In the Fisher setting,
competitive markets contain all markets with weak gross substitutabil-
ity (WGS), a property which enable efficient algorithms for equilibrium
computation.
We show that every uniform utility allocation (UUA) market which is
competitive, is a submodular utility allocation (SUA) market. Our result
provides evidence for the existence of efficient algoritheorems for the class
of competitive markets.

  In this paper, we define a network service provider game. We show that
the price of anarchy of the defined game can be bounded by analyzing
a local search heuristic for a related facility location

that the $k$-facility location problem has a locality gap of 5. This

   We derive efficient algorithms for both detecting and representing
matchings in lopsided bipartite graphs; such graphs have so many
nodes on one side that it is infeasible to represent them in memory or
to identify matchings using standard approaches. Detecting and
representing matchings in lopsided bipartite graphs is important for
allocating and delivering guaranteed-placement display
ads, where the corresponding bipartite graph of interest has nodes
representing advertisers on one side and nodes representing web-page
impressions on the other; real-world instances of such graphs can have
billions of impression nodes. We provide theoretical guarantees for
our algorithms, and in a real-world advertising application, we
demonstrate the feasibility of our detection algorithms.

  We consider the problem of a search engine trying to assign a sequence
of search keywords to a set of competing bidders, each with a daily
spending limit.  The goal is to maximize the revenue generated by these
keyword sales, bearing in mind that, as some bidders may eventually
exceed their budget, not all keywords should be sold to the highest bidder.
We assume that the sequence of keywords (or equivalently, of bids)
is revealed on-line.  Our concern will be the competitive ratio for this
problem versus the off-line optimum.

We extend the current literature on this problem by considering the setting
where the keywords arrive in a random order.  In this setting we are able to
achieve a competitive ratio of $1-\epsilon$ under some mild, but necessary,
assumptions.  In contrast, it is already known that when the keywords arrive
in an adversarial order, the best competitive ratio is bounded away from 1.
Our algorithm is motivated by PAC learning, and proceeds in two parts: a
training phase, and an exploitation phase.

  Determining the integrality gap of the bidirected cut relaxation for the metric Steiner tree
problem, and exploiting it algorithmically, is a long-standing open problem. We use geometry
to define an LP whose dual is equivalent to this relaxation. This opens up the possibility of
using the primal-dual schema in a geometric setting for designing an algorithm for this problem.
Using this approach, we obtain a 4/3 factor algorithm and integrality gap bound for the case
of quasi-bipartite graphs; the previous best integrality gap upper bound being 3/2. We
also obtain a factor $sqrt{2}$ strongly polynomial algorithm for this class of graphs.
A key difficulty experienced by researchers in working with the bidirected cut relaxation
was that any reasonable dual growth procedure produces extremely unwieldy dual solutions.
A new algorithmic idea helps finesse this difficulty -  that of reducing the cost of certain edges
and constructing the dual in this altered instance - and this idea can be extracted into a new
technique for running the primal-dual schema in the setting of approximation algorithms.

Integrality Gaps for Sparsest Cut and Minimum Linear Arrangement Problems

  Arora, Rao and Vazirani
 showed that the standard semi-definite programming (SDP)
 relaxation of the sparsest cut problem with the  triangle
 inequality
 constraints has an integrality gap of $O(\sqrt{\log n})$. They
 conjectured that the gap is bounded from above by a constant. In this paper, we disprove
 this conjecture
 by constructing an $\Omega(\log \log n)$ integrality gap
 instance. Khot and Vishnoi had earlier disproved the
 non-uniform  version of this Conjecture.

A simple ``stretching'' of the integrality gap instance for the
sparsest cut problem serves as an $\Omega(\log \log n)$ integrality gap
instance for the  SDP relaxation of the Minimum Linear Arrangement problem. This
SDP relaxation was considered in Charikar et. al. and Feige and Lee, where it was shown that its integrality gap is bounded
from above by $O(\sqrt{\log n} \log \log n).$

  A vertex k-labeling of graph G is distinguishing if the only automorphism that preserves the labels
of G is the identity map. The distinguishing number of G, D(G), is the smallest integer k for which G
has a distinguishing k-labeling. In this paper, we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion and develop
recursive formulas to count the number of inequivalent distinguishing k-labelings of a graph. Along the
way, we prove that the distinguishing number of a planar graph can be computed in time polynomial in
the size of the graph.

On the complexity of Hilbert's 17th
problem

<P>
  Hilbert posed the following problem as the 17th in the list of 23 problems in his famous 1900 lecture:
 <i>Given a
multivariate polynomial that takes only non-negative values over
the reals, can it be represented as a sum of squares of rational
functions?</i>

In 1927, E.~Artin gave an affirmative answer to this question.
His result guaranteed the existence of such a  finite representation and
raised the following important question:
<i> What is the {\bf minimum number} of rational functions needed to represent
any non-negative $n$-variate, degree $d$  polynomial?</i>

In 1967, Pfister proved that  any $n$-variate non-negative
polynomial over the reals can be written as sum of squares of at most  $2^n$ rational functions.
In spite of a considerable effort by
mathematicians for over 75 years, it is <it> not </it> known
whether $n+2$ rational functions are sufficient!

In lieu of the lack of progress towards the resolution of this question, we initiate the study of  Hilbert's 17th problem from the  point
of view of Computational Complexity.
In this setting, the  following question is a natural relaxation:
<i> What is the {\bf descriptive complexity} of the sum of squares representation (as rational functions) of
a non-negative, $n$-variate, degree $d$  polynomial?</i>
We consider  arithmetic circuits as a natural representation of rational functions.
We are able to show, assuming a standard conjecture in complexity theory, that it is impossible that every non-negative, $n$-variate, degree four
polynomial can be represented as a sum of squares of a  small (polynomial in $n$) number of  rational functions, each of which has a  small size  arithmetic circuit (over the rationals) computing it.

<p>
Our result points to the direction that it is unlikely
that every non-negative, $n$-variate polynomial over the reals can be written as a sum of squares of a polynomial (in $n$)  number of rational functions. Further, relating to standard (and believed to be hard to prove) complexity-theoretic conjectures sheds some light on why it has been difficult for mathematicians to close the $n+2$ and $2^n$ gap. We hope that our line of work will play an important role in the resolution of this question.
